# Traversal Network (TNet)

TensorFlow implementation of the work presented in "Hard-Attention for Scalable Image Classification" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10212.pdf). The code is organized according to the datasets used for the experimental evaluation of TNet. Each folder contains code to convert raw data to TFRecords, to stream input batches, to build TNet and baseline models, and to train and evaluate the models. Trained weights along with instructions to replicate the results presented in the paper, are provided as well.
